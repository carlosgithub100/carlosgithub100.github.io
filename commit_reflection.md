Can I clearly track the development of my website through my commits?
How effectively do the commit messages communicate what I was doing?
How might I embed this process, or something similar in other places of my life?
* I will embed this process into other places of my life such as unchartered work in my new classes senior year or even at my college next year. I feel lke I worked through problem solving skills throughout my process of understanding how to work through Github and deciphering how to code in my repositories.
